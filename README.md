# Multidisciplinary-Framework-for-Asteroid-Capture-Missions
This project develops a multidisciplinary framework to support the early design of asteroid capture missions. It combines low-thrust trajectory optimization, rendezvous and proximity operations modeling, spacecraft sizing. This repository contains the algorithms for RPO trajectories and sliding-mode attitude control.
